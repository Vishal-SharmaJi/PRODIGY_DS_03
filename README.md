                                             ............Code Explanation..........
1. We start by importing the necessary libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn modules for model building, and evaluation metrics.
2. The Bank Marketing dataset is loaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository using the provided URL.
3. We encode the target variable 'y' using LabelEncoder to convert it into numerical values.
4. Features and the target variable are selected from the dataset.
5. The data is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function.
6. A Decision Tree Classifier is initialized and trained on the training data.
7. Predictions are made on the test data using the trained model.
8. The accuracy of the model is calculated by comparing the predicted values with the actual values using the accuracy_score function.
9. Finally, the accuracy of the model is printed to evaluate its performance.
